HUMAN COMPUTER INTERFACE MUSIC TOOLS
(by Lucas Fialho)

The project has some useful tools to anyone who wants to write musical code
using Chuck and some "user friendly" interface (like a PlayStation2 joypad)
that understands HIP (Human Interface Protocol).

Anyone can collaborate \o/

(can someone put a usefull readme file here plz??)
